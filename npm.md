What is npm?
npm is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for Node.js. Recently I completed a learning path Build JavaScript applications with Node.js and found some basic and useful npm commands which were very helpful to me, so I thought of sharing.

Here are some useful npm commands.

To create a package.json in interactive mode, you can use the npm init command.

```
npm init
```

To create a package.json in non interactive mode, use the npm init -y command.

```
npm init -y
```

To get full detailed list of all the commands, type npm –help.

```
npm --help
```

To install any package, you can use npm install command followed by package name.

```
npm install <package name>
```

To install a package for development only which wont be shipped with production build, try the npm install with save-dev parameter. It also adds an entry in devDependencies in package.json.

```
npm install <package name> --save-dev
```

To install a package for production, try with production parameter. It adds an entry in dependencies in package.json.

```
npm install <package name> --production
```

To install a package in global directory instead of project’s node_modules directory, use the g parameter.

```
npm install <package name> -g
```

To take care of fetching the dependency and carrying out the command, and clean up so it is not saved (or do not take up space) in node_modules folder, try the following command.

```
npx <name of package>
```

To list all the packages that your project is depending on, try the npm list command. It uses dependencies section from package.json. Use depth=0 for first level dependencies and depth=1 for 2nd level dependencies and so on.

```
npm list --depth=<depth>
```

To uninstall a package you use the uninstall command. It will remove the package from the manifest file and also from the node_modules directory.

```
npm uninstall <name of dependency>
```

To remove all dependencies in the node_modules directory that are not listed as dependencies in the manifest file, you can try the prune command.

```
npm prune
```

To list all the outdated packages, use the outdated command

```
npm outdated
```

To list vulnerabilities by different severity levels, high, and low for all the packages used in your project, use audit command

```
npm audit
```

To fix the vulnerabilities found by audit, try the audit command with fix.

```
npm audit fix
```

To fix the vulnerabilities found by audit forcefully, try the force parameter.

```
npm audit fix --force
```

To install the latest version, use @latest with npm install command.

```
npm install node-fetch@latest lodash@latest
```

The following instruction will update to the latest patch version. If you only want the patch version to update, you would specify like this ~1.0.0. What this instruction says is equal or great to in the same range.

```
~1.1.1 or 1.1.x
```

The following instruction will update only the minor version.

```
^1.1.1 or 1.x.1
```

The following instruction will update to the highest major version.

```
*1.1.1 or x.0.0
```

The package-lock.json guarantees exact installs.

The following command starts debugger that comes bundled with Node.js.

```
node inspect myscript.js
```
